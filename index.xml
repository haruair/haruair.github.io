      <title>New Year&#39;s Resolution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to make a list. New year&amp;rsquo;s resolution is one of the things, I almost
forget about it at the end of the year, though. I want to list some ideas for
2017:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep writing a blog as much as I did last year. But the difference is that the
posts will be written by English.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read more. When I read something, it still very slow. Probably I will grab
Kindle again, want to spend more time with the text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do coding. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything with open source in last year because of the
translation. I want to make something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is the three big things in this year. Will see what I can achieve at
the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I want to mention here something, I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak in public just yet. I got
an opportunity from somewhere else. The position is a quite different rather
than the current one. I need to digest new environments and also tech stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost 5 years since I moved in Melbourne. I always said that English is
the important if someone want to live here, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any effort
during this period. I did some preparation for IELTS once, that study was not
intence at all because the goal was quite low points. In this time, I want to
study intensively. My expectation of this year is studying like a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://koreanteenlife.wordpress.com/2015/01/22/gosam/&#34;&gt;gosam&lt;/a&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice makes perfect. Everyone knows that, most of people doesn&amp;rsquo;t do that.
I will make it for the perfection with this resolution in this year.&lt;/p&gt;
