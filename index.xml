      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about Go, but I saw so many tweets it&amp;rsquo;s a great language, performance wise especially. Hugo is a static blog/site generator written by Go. I feel great with Hugo because of the simplicity. The program is provided as a single binary file. Other tools require a lot of small settings, installing language, setting envrionment, handling a package manager, for example. It still requires some config file, but no worries, it&amp;rsquo;s not that big.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve sold Dell XPS 13 because of a keyboard, I&amp;rsquo;m back to Dell Inspiron 11 3000. I bought this marchine 8 months ago, Windows 10 was a bit heavy on this laptop. So I replaced OS as Lubuntu. The laptop is low spec but it&amp;rsquo;s not bad for the normal terminal work.
Only thing I hate is that this laptop doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a palm rejection. The touch pad is almost unusable, I think they forgot someone actually can use it as a pointing device.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got an IntegrityError when I remove the user from django-admin. I uses custom User model, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t change that much rather than AbrstractUser from django.contrib.auth.models. The error was like this:
IntegrityError: (1048, &amp;quot;Column &#39;user_id&#39; cannot be null&amp;quot;)  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the case at all. I asussemed that the error occurs from MySQL, I checked all table schema one by one and finally found the reason.
One of the model includes User ForeignKey with on_delete=models.</description>

      <title>New Year&#39;s Resolution</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d love to make a list. New year&amp;rsquo;s resolution is one of the things, I almost forget about it at the end of the year, though. I want to list some ideas for 2017:
 Keep writing a blog as much as I did last year. But the difference is that the posts will be written by English. Read more. When I read something, it still very slow. Probably I will grab Kindle again, want to spend more time with the text.</description>
